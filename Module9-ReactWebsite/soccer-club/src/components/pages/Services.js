      <p>We offer a casual membership free of charge. However, if you miss more than half the games per season, we might ask you to leave.</p>
    <h2>Competitive Membership</h2>
      <p>For the serious soccer fans, we have competitive teams. The rules are much stricter here and we require attendance as well as a registration fee per season.</p>
